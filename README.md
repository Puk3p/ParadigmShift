# Programming Paradigms - Comprehensive Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises completed during my "Programming Paradigms" course. The projects span various programming paradigms, utilizing languages such as Python and Kotlin to explore functional programming, object-oriented programming, concurrency, and more. Each project demonstrates specific technical skills and concepts learned throughout the course.

## Functional Programming in Kotlin

### Project 1: Data Processing Operations
**Description:** Implemented complex functional operations on a list of integers, including filtering, grouping, arithmetic operations, and aggregation.
- **Skills:** Higher-order functions, lambda expressions, collection operations.
- **Details:**
  - Removed numbers less than 5.
  - Grouped numbers into pairs and performed multiplication.
  - Summed the results of the multiplications.

### Project 2: Caesar Cipher Encryption
**Description:** Developed a script to read content from a text file and encrypt specific words using a Caesar cipher.
- **Skills:** File I/O, string manipulation, functional programming.
- **Details:**
  - Encrypted words with lengths between 4 and 7 characters using a given offset.

## Object-Oriented Programming and Design Patterns

### Project 3: Double Chain of Responsibility
**Description:** Designed and implemented a double chain of responsibility pattern to process requests and send responses back through a hierarchical chain of handlers.
- **Skills:** Design patterns, coroutines, asynchronous processing.
- **Details:**
  - Created handlers using abstract factory patterns.
  - Managed request and response handling with coroutines.

### Project 4: Web Crawling with Jsoup
**Description:** Developed a web crawler to process RSS feeds, extracting and storing metadata in a custom ADT.
- **Skills:** Web scraping, XML parsing, data structures.
- **Details:**
  - Parsed XML data to extract title, link, description, and publication date.

## Web Crawler and Database Management

### Project 5: Web Crawler with Jsoup and SQLite Integration
**Description:** Combined web crawling capabilities with database management to store and retrieve persistent data.
- **Skills:** Web scraping, database management, data persistence.
- **Details:**
  - Processed RSS feeds and stored metadata in an SQLite database.
  - Retrieved and displayed stored data.

## Concurrent Programming and Coroutines

### Project 6: P2P Game with State Machines and Coroutines
**Description:** Implemented a P2P game where player actions were synchronized across networked instances using state machines and coroutines.
- **Skills:** State machines, coroutines, network programming.
- **Details:**
  - Managed game states and transitions with state machines.
  - Synchronized player actions using coroutines.

### Project 7: Request Handling with Coroutines
**Description:** Developed an application to process and respond to requests asynchronously using coroutines.
- **Skills:** Asynchronous processing, coroutine management.
- **Details:**
  - Handled incoming requests and sent responses through a double chain of responsibility.

## Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms

### Project 8: Custom Data Structures for File Processing
**Description:** Designed and implemented custom data structures to process log files and identify file types based on content.
- **Skills:** Data structures, algorithm design, file processing.
- **Details:**
  - Analyzed character frequencies to categorize files as ASCII/UTF8 text, UNICODE/UTF16 text, or binary.

## Conclusion
Through these projects, I have developed a solid foundation in Python and Kotlin, enhancing my skills in functional programming, object-oriented design, concurrency, and advanced data structures. This repository showcases my ability to tackle complex software development tasks and provides a comprehensive overview of the knowledge and experience gained during the "Programming Paradigms" course.

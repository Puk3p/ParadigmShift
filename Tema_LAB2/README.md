# Expanded Summary of Laboratory 1

## Introduction
This document serves as a comprehensive lab manual for familiarizing with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm, as well as the version control system Git. It outlines the procedures for setting up and managing software development projects across various programming languages including Java, Python, and Kotlin.

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Java Projects in IntelliJ IDEA:**
   - Creating new projects.
   - Building and executing projects.
   - Debugging techniques and monitoring variable changes during runtime.

2. **Python Projects in PyCharm:**
   - Setting up new Python projects.
   - Establishing virtual environments for Python to manage dependencies.
   - Detailed debugging instructions and runtime variable tracking.

3. **Kotlin Projects in IntelliJ IDEA:**
   - Steps to initiate new Kotlin projects.
   - Building and running Kotlin applications.
   - Debugging applications and the use of breakpoints to inspect code flow.

4. **Version Control with Git:**
   - Basic Git setup and configuration commands.
   - Integrating Git into IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Cloning, committing, and managing code changes in a repository.

5. **Advanced Git Features:**
   - Working with remote repositories.
   - Managing branches and merging changes.
   - Strategies for commit messages and handling merge conflicts.

## Development and Debugging
The guide emphasizes the importance of understanding IDE features such as the debugger, which allows for step-by-step code analysis and helps identify logical errors in code. Each section provides practical examples to ensure students can apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Git and Version Control
Proper use of Git is discussed extensively to ensure students can manage changes to their projects efficiently. This includes the setup of local and remote repositories, the distinction between different stages of a Git project (modified, staged, committed), and best practices for using Git in a collaborative environment.

## Accomplishments - Exercise 1
Choose one of the projects (i.e., select a specific programming language) and extend the calculator so that it can analyze and compute complex mathematical expressions (for example: 2*(4-5/6)/456). For this task, you should use explicit Polish notation evaluation (not the version with simulated stacks using arrays). You may also opt to implement this using trees.
